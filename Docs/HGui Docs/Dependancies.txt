No plugins required, just pure Hollywood modules devepoled by me:

@INCLUDE "+Includes.hws"            All libraries index
@INCLUDE #INC_HELPERS               Helpers library
@INCLUDE #INC_TABLES                Tables library
@INCLUDE #INC_G2D                   Graphics2D library
@INCLUDE #INC_DEBUG                 Debug library
@INCLUDE #INC_TEXTPROC              TextProcessing library

These dependancies are handled by HGui, you don't need to install them separately, just follow what I explain in the 'quick tutorial' section.
