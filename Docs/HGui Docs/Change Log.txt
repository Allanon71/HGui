    NEW : Started to work seriously on the documentation
  
  23/03/2021
    FIX : ListView, when HScrollerOFF=True the autosize of the columns didn't

          the 'alignments' table where, for each column, you have to specify
          the alignment, default is LEFT.
    FIX : Changed how ListVIews are rendered.

  05/08/2020
    ADD : InputBox now accept a 'Caption' field to enter an optional description

          with 'valuemax' and 'valuemin' tags

          wasn't starting from 0
    ADD : Added 'perc' tag to ProgressWindow & ProgressBar cursor
          text.
    ADD : 'cursortext' tag to the ProgressWindow to set what to

  09/04/2020
    FIX : Background pictures were not freely correctly
    FIX : Transitions in image gadgets crashed when a new window with a bgpic
          was created.
          
  27/02/2019
    NEW : Window's flag 'modal' can now be correctly used.
    
  26/10/2018
    NEW : Image Class now support 'FadeIn' argument, set it to True
          to let the image appear using a crossfade fx.
          
  23/02/2017
    FIX : When a text in a TextObject was changed HGui was generating an
          <OnInputEnd> event to signal that the text was changed, thought this
          way was easily generating recursive callbacks causing stack overflow
          so it has been disabled.
  
  12/12/2017
    FIX : There was missing parameters when the callback 'OnChange' for TreeView
          items was called.
    NEW : Added flag 'selectGroups' (default to True), if it is set to false the
          group items cannot be selected.
          
  07/11/2017
    FIX : ListView's :set() method. When using the special tag 'selected' to pass
          a single item to be selected (a numeric value), there was no check
          to see if the ListView was allowing 'multi-selection'. This was
          causing multiple selections on 'single-selection' ListViews using this
          specific tag.
          
  08/11/2017
    NEW : ListView -> Added method :Insert() to add a single record, this is
          an additional way to add items (see special tag 'insert' of the :set()
          method for further details).
    NEW : ListView -> Added event 'OnInsert' raised when an item has been added
          to the ListView.
    DOC : Improved the HGui.Window:InputBoxNew(params) documentation.
    NEW : Added new method HGui.Gadget:freeChildren(refresh) to free all children
          attached to a gadget. This is usefull when you have to create gadget
          groups at runtime.
          
  10/11/2017
    NEW : Added :link() and :unlink() methods to automate common operations with
          linked gadgets. For example with this method you can link [+] and [-]
          buttons to a text gadget and increase/decrease the current value without
          additional code. One gadget can have multiple targets and multiple
          actions. The skinMaker program will show this new feature (actually in
          development).
    FIX : Fixed a rendering rare bug in the Text class that was preventing the
          contents rendering.
    NOTE : Discovered a bug in multiline text gadgets. If you insert a blank line,
           go to the last line and hit the Home button to reach the first character
           the program will crash. This problem is not yet fixed.

  04/11/2017
    FIX : Now all dropdown menus are hidden from the taskbar (Thank you Andreas)
    NEW : As a result of the above change now another window's flag has been
          added : HideFromTaskBar (default=False).
    FIX : When a floating tip of a menu item was showed the menu was closed.
    FIX : Now when a floating tip is showed it is hidden from the task bar.
    NEW : Added new tags recognition in the :InputBoxNew() window's method.
    NEW : Old changes moved to an external file named 'HGui_ChangeLog.txt'
    FIX : Removed a bug in the Group object creation, sometimes object children
          was rendered in the wrong windows.
    FIX : When using proportional column sizes in ListView an TreeView, resizing
          a column could cause graphical glitches. It has been fixed, however
          the resize switches the columns from a proportional hadnling to absolute
          handling, so it needs more love. Anyway in the current form it
          is working just fine.

OLDER CHANGES WEREN'T TRACKED
