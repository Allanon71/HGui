     <h1>Quick Tutorial</h1>

    <p>This is a very quick tutorial to let you start using HGui.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>HOW TO INSTALL HGui and it's related modules</strong></span>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Head your browser at my GitHub page → <a href="https://github.com/Allanon71/Hollywood-MAL-Libraries">https://github.com/Allanon71/Hollywood-MAL-Libraries</a>
      </li>
      <li>Click on the green button “Code” and a menu will open</li>
      <li>On your LOCAL tab press the “Download ZIP” button to download the entire
        repository on your local machine.</li>
      <li>Once the download ends open the archive and uncompress the contents where
        you prefer</li>
      <li>Open the file <code>+Includes.hws</code> and edit the line <code>Const #INC_PATH = ""</code>,
        you have to specify the absolute location where you have uncompressed the
        archive, for example it could be something like this:&nbsp;
        <br><code>C:/MyHollywoodStuff/Libs/AllanonLibs/</code>
      </li>
      <li>Save the edited file</li>
      <li>You are ready!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>INCLUDING HGui</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>To work with HGui the first step in your code should to include the library
      into your source, if the previous step was correct (installation) it's
      enough to add these two lines into your source code:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">@INCLUDE "&lt;path-where-you-have-extracted-the-archive&gt;/+Includes.hws"
@INCLUDE #INC_HGUI</code></pre>
    <p>Inside the file <code>+Includes.hws</code> you will find some constants
      you can use to include my libraries into your projects, even without using
      HGui. For example, if you would want to use only the Date &amp; Time library
      you'd only need to:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">@INCLUDE "&lt;path-where-you-have-extracted-the-archive&gt;/+Includes.hws"
@INCLUDE #INC_DATETIME</code></pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>HELLO WORLD WITH HGui</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>Tutorial <strong>T304 - Hello World.hws</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>
      <br><strong>This example expects that you have not changed the examples directory, they should be in </strong><code>&lt;path-where-you-have-extracted-the-archive&gt;/Examples/HGui</code> that's
      why at the beginning of the code we are referring to the <code>+Includes.hws</code> file
      two directories up.</p>
    <p>Let's start including HGui</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">@INCLUDE "../../+Includes.hws"
@INCLUDE #INC_HGUI</code></pre>
    <p>Now we are going to create a window to contain our ‘Hello World’ text,
      you can see that we are specifying a few arguments to:
      <br>- Setup the window's title
      <br>- Setup the window's name, it is used internally
      <br>- Specify how the window should be positioned</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Local myWin = HGui.Window:new(
   { title = "Hello World!",
     name  = "myWindow",
     position   = { x = #CENTER, y = #CENTER }
     })</code></pre>
    <p>The following &nbsp;command it's not really needed because we are going
      to add only a simple label gadget, but it's a good practice to switch off
      auto rendering while building GUIs because if not disabled, everytime you
      add a new gadget, a window refresh will be issued causing flickering which
      is not so nice to see.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">HGui.SetAutoRendering(False)</code></pre>
    <p>Now it's time to create our label gadget that will be used to show the
      “Hello World!” string:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Local myLabel = HGui.Gadget:new(#HGUI_LABEL_GADGET, { caption = "Hello World!" })</code></pre>
    <p>Just creating a gadget it's not enough, we need to tell HGui where we
      have to place it, this task is accomplished using the <code>:layoutSet()</code> method,
      as you can see we are using the method with the <strong>root gadget</strong> of
      our window. The root gadget is a special gadget created for you when a
      window is created, it is the root of every gadget you are going to place
      in the window's gui.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">mywin.rootgadget:layoutSet({ gadgets = { myLabel } }, True )</code></pre>
    <p>Now let's enable the auto rendering feature:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">HGui.SetAutoRendering(True)</code></pre>
    <p>To be sure that all has been rendered correctly let's force a window refresh:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">myWin:Render()</code></pre>
    <p>Is it simple enough? :D</p>
    <p>Last step is to enter a neverending loop because HGui is event driven
      and we do not need to listen manually for events:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Repeat
  WaitEvent()
Forever</code></pre>
    <p>Open your task manager and see how CPU time this program takes, it should
      be very low.</p>
    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>HGui comes with some <strong>examples</strong> and <strong>tests</strong> you
      can use to start learning how to build your GUIs, they are full of comments
      about how things work so you should understand how to work with HGui easily
      but if you are in troubles feel free to contact me via my <strong>Patreon</strong> page
      or using Hollywood's official forum.</p>
    <p>Tests and examples can be found in the directory <code>/examples/HGui/</code>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Let me say it clearly: HGui is free for all, I enjoyed to code it and
      I learned tons of things coding this big project. I coded it mainly for
      me and for my applications as a self-challange but I realized that limiting
      this library only for my personal use was a pity… Hollywood coders could
      have learned something using it or simply looking at how I implemented
      stuff so I decided to make it public.&nbsp;
      <br>What wasn't really fun was writing this guide due to the amount of methods,
      functions and classes so what I ask is just a little thanks for the time
      I spent writing docs &amp; examples, nothing more.
      <br>So, If you want say thanks and have the possibility to donate some bucks,
      please join my Patreon page and support my work, you will have access to
      more in-depth docs &amp; examples as an additional reward :)</p>
