     <h1>Experimental Features (IMPORTANT)</h1>

    <p>In some circumstances, especially with quick redraws, you may experience
      a lot of flickering.</p>
    <p>I'm working on a solution using the <code>BeginRefresh()</code> / <code>EndRefresh()</code> commands
      entirely handled by <code>HGui</code> which will keep tracks of the windows
      where it is active and where is not.</p>
    <p>This is necessary because HGui and its layout system are heavily recursive
      so a handler for those mentioned function is necessary.</p>
    <p>Right now this feature is implemented only on the <code>gadget:set()</code> method,
      since it is experimental you may experience malfunctions so you have the
      possibility to switch this feature OFF simply typing this code in your
      source:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">HGui.RefreshBlockEnabled = False</code></pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please report any issue you may find because with this feature a very
      smooth UI is really possible even with very complex interface.</p>
