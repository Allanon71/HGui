     <h1>Project Description</h1>

    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>HGui is one of the biggest project I worked on and its development started
      back in the 2011.</p>
    <p>The very first attempt was called scuiLib but after a few years I realized
      how to properly code such a project using OOP to simplify the code required
      to build user interfaces.</p>
    <p>I've to admit that MUI inspired me a lot in this adventure and now, even
      if the project it's still incomplete, I can say that it's very robust,
      flexible and very usable. I cannot say this was easy… but I enjoyed (and
      still enjoying) the development of HGui.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I've used it to produce many applications, even very heavy ones in terms
      of interface complexity, without major issues.</p>
    <p>Of course all can be made better and I will do it as soon as me or users
      will need new features that will make HGui even better.</p>
    <p>I've to be honest: I'm very proud of this work :D</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>FEATURES</strong></span>
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li><strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong>, you will code your app GUIs
        using objects and methods</li>
      <li>Flexible and multi-layered <strong>skin system</strong>, you can create
        even complex themes or very simple (and light) ones, the skin system offers
        you a fully featured subsystem.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy of use</strong>, at least for me :)</li>
      <li><strong>Fast</strong>, especially when using light skins and/or using
        the cache system (enabled by default)</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable</strong> (tuning the cache system and the theme you can
        balance the cpu consumption and the memory usage)</li>
      <li><strong>Pure Hollywood code</strong> : this means that HGui does not depend
        on any system specific command/library, all developed apps using HGui can
        be compiled for any system supported by Hollywood (Android needs some attention).
        <br>Your app GUI will be the same on every platform, exactly the same.
        <br>The only requirements are a few support includes (written in pure Hollywood
        by me) available with HGui.</li>
      <li><strong>WINDOWS</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Every HGui window supports the following events:
            <br>OnClose, OnMove, OnActivate, OnDeactivate, OnHide, OnShow, OnSize</li>
          <li>A lot of customization is available when creating new windows</li>
          <li>Automatic control of the window’s order (window's stack)</li>
          <li>Methods to control/edit on the fly the created windows</li>
          <li>Various window's background types supported</li>
          <li>Special methods to quickly build:
            <ul>
              <li>Progress indicators</li>
              <li>System requesters</li>
              <li>Text boxes</li>
              <li>Wait windows</li>
              <li>Soft Keypads</li>
              <li>Soft Keyboards</li>
              <li>Input boxes</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Custom window’s menu (not the ones available with Hollywood but a custom
            one that allow you to include any gadget type in it).</li>
          <li>Utility functions to find window objects by name, by Hollywood ID, and
            to check if a window exists or not.</li>
          <li>Ability to attach hotkeys to any window to execute specific tasks when
            a key press occurs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>GADGET CLASSES</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Box</li>
          <li>Vertical Divider</li>
          <li>Horizontal Divider</li>
          <li>Label</li>

          <li>Slider (Vertical/Horizontal)</li>
          <li>Progress Bar</li>
          <li>Knob</li>
          <li>Text (for user input)</li>
          <li>Listview</li>

      </li>
      <li><strong>GADGET SYSTEM</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to switch the cache system on or off, &nbsp;when enabled each
            gadget state will be cached, a lot faster but more memory is required.
            When disabled each gadget state will be rendered on the fly, slower but
            with a much lower memory footprint.</li>
          <li>Each gadget can have its own skin.</li>
          <li>Each gadget class can have its own skin.</li>
          <li>Support for icons inside gadgets with custom alignment and text adjustment</li>
          <li>Flying tips for active gadgets</li>
          <li>Hotkeys can be defined for each active gadget</li>
          <li>You can attach sounds to some actions (OnOver, OnOut, OnPushed, OnDown)</li>
          <li>Supported actions (some gadget classes may have additional actions):
            <ul
            style="list-style-type:circle;">
              <li>OnPushed : Triggered when the left mouse button released (always after
                an OnDown event)</li>
              <li>OnDown : Triggered when the left mouse button is pressed</li>
              <li>OnOver : Triggered when the mouse enters a gadget's area</li>
              <li>OnOut : Triggered when the mouse exits a gadget's area</li>
              <li>OnDrop : Triggere when something is dropped inside a gadget's area</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Functions to search buttons by their names</li>
        <li>Methods to control and modify on the fly existing gadgets</li>
        <li>Ability to attach a right-mouse action or a pop up menu on each active
          gadget</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>LAYOUT SYSTEM</strong>
      <br>Gadgets can be arranged using the famous <a href="http://www.sasg.com/mui/"><u>MUI</u></a> library
      concept: you define some gadgets that will be grouped inside another gadget,
      this way your GUI is represented by a tree where the tree root is a special
      gadget called rootGadget, this special gadget is created for you automatically
      when a window is created.
      <br>This system supports 3 layouts:
      <ul>
        <li>Vertical</li>
        <li>Horizontal</li>
        <li>Grid</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When you define child gadgets you can define the following properties:
      <ul>
        <li>Gadget weights (percentual variable, percentual fixed, pixel variable,
          pixel fixed)</li>
        <li>Borders (top, bottom, left, right) from the parent gadget</li>
        <li>Gap between gadget childs in pixel</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="text-big"><strong>WHAT’S MISSING/NEEDS MORE LOVE</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>As I said HGui is still missing some core features like the ones listed
      below:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li>Keyboard navigation system (very high priority)</li>
      <li>Gadget’s drag &amp; drop (drag one or more gadgets over another one) (low
        priority)</li>
      <li>Tabs class (high priority)</li>
      <li>Spin class (normal priority)</li>
      <li>Better documentation (yes… this one isn't enough, I will improve it if
        there is enough interest from users)</li>
      <li>Tutorials (Some basic examples are provided but they do not cover everything
        HGui can offer)</li>
      <li>Global theme management functions are not complete (high priority)</li>
      <li>Support for a way to separate Gui definitions from the code (low priority)</li>
    </ul>
