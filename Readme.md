# HGui ToolKit

### v1.7 (23/02/2023) by Fabio Falcucci aka Allanon

HGui is a **GUI ToolKit** for [Hollywood-MAL](https://www.hollywood-mal.com) written in plain Hollywood-MAL.

The only needed requiremens are the includes provided with the HGui distribution.

HGui offers unique features to you but the main purpose is to allow the programmer to have cross-compile applications that are able to render the exact same interface on all the platforms supported by Hollywood.

You don't need any external plugin to use HGui.

HGui comes with a **fully commented source code**, many examples and tutorials, an html manual and, for those willing to support me on Patreon, there is support and personalized examples.

HGui is released as free software but donations are welcome.

### SETUP

Before you can start to use HGui you have to setup the includes path, it's very simple:

1. Open the file '+Includes.hws'
2. Change the constant `#INC_PATH`
   `Const #INC_PATH = 'absolute-path-where-this-file-is-located'`
3. Save the file
4. Done

Now you can run the examples and the tutorials but first of all I suggest you to
run the '`Examples/HGui/000 - Showcase.hws`' where almost all features has been
used.

If you want to support me please join my Patreon page where some exclusive content
about HGui will be published from time to time.

### NOTE ABOUT INCLUDES

Please note that the includes that comes with HGui are not necessary the same as the ones in [GitHub - Allanon71/Hollywood-MAL-Libraries: Hollywood-MAL Helpers Library](https://github.com/Allanon71/Hollywood-MAL-Libraries), the ones that comes with HGui are tested with HGui and are placed in the same repository as HGui for simplicity, so that users can have all the needed stuff in a single place. By the way I will try to keep them in sync.

### HISTORY

This project was born around 14 years ago and its first incarnation was called ScuiLib, I needed gadgets for my programs and I decided to build a GUI library by myself since at that time there was no plugins to build UIs.

The time passed and I learned many things about Hollywood-MAL which also evolved adding more and more features at every new release.

ScuiLib was used as a starting point for a new version called HGui, and after some time I started to create applications with it.

HGui still misses some features but it's fully usable and stable so I decided that do no sharing my work with others would be a pity. I decided to share my work but before reaching this point I spent countless hours writing the documentation, the examples and some tutorials.

With my efforts I hope to help Hollywood-MAL to grow its userbase because it deserves it, and I will be honest with you all: I also hope to raise a bit the support on my Partreon page :)

### SUPPORT

Support is granted for all my Patrons and for people asking on the official [Hollywood-MAL forum]((https://forums.hollywood-mal.com/).

Patrons can also be able to ask for examples or explanations that are not included in the documentation.

### COPYRIGHTED FILES
